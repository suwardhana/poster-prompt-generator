# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Poster Prompt Generator is a React-based web application that helps users create AI-optimized prompts for generating event posters. The application features a modern glassmorphism design and provides a streamlined interface where users input event details and receive tailored prompts based on their selected poster style.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want to input basic event information through a form, so that I can generate appropriate poster prompts without having to craft them manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads the application THEN the system SHALL display a form with six input fields: speaker name, event date and time, event name, event info contact, event location, and poster style dropdown
2. WHEN the user enters text in any input field THEN the system SHALL accept and store the input value
3. WHEN the user selects a date and time THEN the system SHALL format the input appropriately for poster generation
4. WHEN the user provides contact information THEN the system SHALL validate the format is reasonable for display on a poster

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from different poster styles, so that the generated prompt matches the tone and aesthetic I'm aiming for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the poster style dropdown THEN the system SHALL display options including "modern", "formal", "playful", and other relevant styles
2. WHEN the user selects a poster style THEN the system SHALL store the selection and use it to influence prompt generation
3. WHEN no style is selected THEN the system SHALL use a default style or prompt the user to make a selection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a generated AI prompt based on my inputs, so that I can copy it and use it with image generation tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has filled in the required form fields THEN the system SHALL automatically generate an AI image prompt in the result area below the form
2. WHEN the user changes any form input THEN the system SHALL update the generated prompt in real-time
3. WHEN the poster style is changed THEN the system SHALL adjust the prompt wording to match the selected style's characteristics
4. WHEN the generated prompt is displayed THEN the system SHALL make it easy to copy the text

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a modern, visually appealing interface with glassmorphism styling, so that the tool itself reflects contemporary design trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads the application THEN the system SHALL display a glassmorphism-styled interface with translucent elements and backdrop blur effects
2. WHEN the user interacts with form elements THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and modern visual feedback
3. WHEN the application is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design principles
4. WHEN the user views the two-row layout THEN the system SHALL clearly separate the form section above from the prompt result section below

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the prompt generation to be intelligent and contextual, so that the output is optimized for AI image generation tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "modern" style THEN the system SHALL include contemporary design keywords and clean aesthetic descriptors in the prompt
2. WHEN the user selects "formal" style THEN the system SHALL include professional, elegant, and traditional design elements in the prompt
3. WHEN the user selects "playful" style THEN the system SHALL include vibrant, creative, and fun design elements in the prompt
4. WHEN generating any prompt THEN the system SHALL include technical parameters that work well with AI image generators (aspect ratios, quality indicators, etc.)
5. WHEN all event details are provided THEN the system SHALL structure the prompt to clearly communicate the event information within the design context
